## Inspiration and Thanks!
This Project is heavily inspired by a few other projects:
heimcontrol.js - http://ni-c.github.io/heimcontrol.js/ - i wanted to have something like this that I understand
arduinoPi - https://github.com/JanStevens/ArduinoPi-Controller - here I understood the working of the php_serial.class - thanks a lot!
